[*** I did NOT collaborate with anyone for this assignment. ***]

[*] To run the homework, please run the "GUI" class containing the main method.

  There aren't any special instructions to run it, there are two buttons: one of which updates the label beside it on 
  how many times the user has pressed the button, and the other which simply flips between on and off.
