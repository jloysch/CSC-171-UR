[*** I did NOT collaborate with anyone for this assignment. ***]

[*] To run the homework, please run the "Driver.java" class containing the main method.

  To draw a circle, simply click the left mouse button, you can also drag. To clear the canvas (I kept this separate because
  I was not exactly sure what some things meant in the prompt) click the right mouse button. Text typing also works and will work
  until canvas is cleared, I also added backspace functionality though everything isn't perfect.
